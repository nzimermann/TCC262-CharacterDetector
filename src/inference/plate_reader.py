"""Assemble detected characters into a plate string, in reading order.

Doesn't assume the plate is level with the camera: the reading direction is
computed from the detected characters' own positions (via PCA), not from
the image's x/y axes, so a tilted or diagonally-viewed plate still reads
correctly. Also handles 2-row plates (motorcycles: 3 letters, 4 digits)
the same way as 1-row plates (cars), by splitting rows along the axis
perpendicular to the reading direction instead of the image's raw y-axis.

`classify_plate` then checks the assembled string against the two valid
Brazilian plate formats (Mercosul and the older one), to filter out
partial/garbled reads instead of accepting anything detected.
